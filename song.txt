Things haven't been quite the same
There's a haze on the horizon, babe
It's only been a couple of days
And I miss you, mm, yeah
When nothin' really goes to plan
You stub your toe or break your camera
I'll do everythin' I can
To help you through

If you're feelin' down
I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around
I just wanna make you happier, baby

We've been doin' all this late night talkin'
'Bout anythin' you want until the mornin'
Now you're in my life
I can't get you off my mind

I've never been a fan of change
But I'd follow you to any place
If it's Hollywood or Bishopsgate
I'm coming too

If you're feelin' down
I just wanna make you happier, baby
Wish I was around
I just wanna make you happier, baby
